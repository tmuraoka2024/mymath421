## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation. We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page.

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` or Quarto (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title.

**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows:

```         
- In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown

- In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK

- Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 
```

-   You can also use the Rmd templates of the class slides.

-   You can also use Quarto to create the presentation: *In Rstudio -\> File -\> New File -\> Quarto Presentation...*

-   You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.

-   To inset an image in a slide, use `![](image.png)`

-   To scale images, you can use `![](image.png){width="60%"}` or follow these below instructions.

    -   <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figure-size.html>

    -   <http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/>

-   To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use: `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell.

**What to present**:

-   Present Part 2 - Visualization

-   Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.

-   Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them.

**Data:**

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data. Each row of the data presents a patient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I. Data Wranggling

```{r}
library(haven)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

1.  Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.

```{r}
#url <- 'https://drive.google.com/open?id=15QNBf6YYKocK2nNIfpKDer58kQnCPNZJ'
#file <- 'hdd0318cy.sas7bdat'

#download.file(url, file)
```

2.  Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data.

```{r}
data <- read_sas('hdd0318cy.sas7bdat')
```

3.  Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod=18`)

```{r}
data <- data %>%
  filter(yod == 18)
```

4.  Select to work with only following variables:

```{r}
features <- c("yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
              "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
              "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" ,

df %>% 
  filter(sex == 1) %>%
  group_by(moa) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n)
```

9.  Which month has the most number of teenage female patients?

```{r}
# March
df %>%
  filter(sex == 2, (age > 12) & (age < 18)) %>%
  group_by(moa) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n)
  
```

10. Which provider has the most number of female patients in October?

```{r}

  summarise(mean_age = mean(age)) %>%
  arrange(-mean_age)
```

12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?

```{r}
# Janruary has the oldest patients, on average. 
df %>%
  group_by(moa) %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age)) %>%
  arrange(-mean_age)
```

13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?

```{r}
# Bradley
head(df)
df %>%
  group_by(provider) %>%
  summarise(mean_charge = mean(tot)) %>%
  arrange(-mean_charge)
```

14. What is the name of the provider that has the least total charge for teenage male on average?

```{r}
#Bradley
df %>%
  filter(sex == 1, (age > 12) & (age < 18)) %>%
  group_by(provider) %>%
  summarise(mean_charge = mean(tot)) %>%
  arrange(-mean_charge)
```

15. Create a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) variable. Calculate the length of stays by season. Which season has the longest length of stays on average?

```{r}
spring <- c(3, 4, 5)
summer <- c(6, 7, 8)
fall <- c(9, 10, 11)
winter <- c(12, 1, 2)

df_wSeason <- df
df_wSeason$season <- case_when(
  df$moa %in% spring ~ 'Spring',
  df$moa %in% summer ~ 'Summer',
  df$moa %in% fall ~ 'Fall',
  df$moa %in% winter ~ 'Winter'
)

write_csv(df_wSeason, 'midterm_season.csv')
```

16. On average, how much a 20 year-old male get charged for staying 1 day in the Fall season?

```{r}
# $16,511
head(df_wSeason)
df_wSeason %>%
  filter(age == 20, sex == 1, los == 1, season == 'Fall') %>%
  summarise(mean_charge = mean(tot))
```

17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. You could do some other calculations to support your points.

Based on the results from this section, there are many conclusions that can be made from our analysis. For one thing, with providers, it seems Bradley is a very popular hospital in our dataset. While it holds a large majority of patients in our dataset, it also accounts for the higher charges on average as well. This high charge can also add into the idea that this is probably our more popular, and trafficked hospital. Also, it seems the busiest month in our dataset is October. However for women in particular, March is the busiest month for female patients. All around, I believe there were many conclusions we could make about our dataset in this analysis. This worked to be a good exploratory analysis for future visualization creation, and model building for our later sections.

  theme_minimal() +
  transition_states(provider, transition_length = 3, state_length = 4) +
  enter_fade() +
  exit_fade()
```

3.  Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results.

I think this section compliments the previous section where we did some initial exploratory analysis nicely. In this section, we have gotten to visualize very important characteristics of our dataset. We begin by observing the distributions of both ages, and the length of stays of patients. After being able to observe our plots, we were able to see how evenly distributed our ages are, and how uneven our length of stay values are as well. There are many outliers with length of stay in comparison to age where its much more normally distributed. While this isn't an astonishing find, it is noteworthy. Also, being able to see what ages stay the longest, and what age ranges stay longer than average in our dataset was useful. We were also able to see what patients are charged based on provider. We also got to visualize time series data, which also helped to understand our dataset from a different angle.

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Make sure you do not have any missing values in the data. Use the follows as the target and input variables:

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of

-   `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

-   `high` otherwise.

*Input Variables*:

-   "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
library(rpart)
library(caret)
library(rattle)
```

1.  Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90

```{r}
df$target <- if_else(df$tot < median(df$tot, na.rm=TRUE), 'low', 'high')
df$raceethn <- ifelse(is.na(df$raceethn), 'Unknown', df$raceethn)

df <- drop_na(df)

clean_df <- df %>%
  select(age, sex, raceethn, provider,
         moa, mod, admtype, campus, los, target) %>%
  mutate(age = as.numeric(age),
         sex = as.factor(sex),
         campus = as.factor(campus),
         provider = as.factor(provider),
         campus = as.factor(campus),
         los = as.numeric(los),
         moa = as.factor(moa),
         mod = as.factor(mod),
         target = as.factor(target)) %>%
  filter((raceethn != '') & (admtype != ''))

splitIndex <- createDataPartition(clean_df$target, p = 0.4, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train <- clean_df[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- clean_df[-splitIndex,]
```

2.  Train a decision tree using `rpart`. Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree.

```{r}
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                    control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 5))

fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
```

```{r}
tree_model$variable.importance
```

3.  Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models. Train & tune at least 2 different models (i.e. two different values for `method=` in the train function of caret). Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model.

```{r}
trControl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)

hyperparameters <- expand.grid(
  cp = seq(0.001, 0.1, by = 0.001)
)

class_model1 <- train(
  target ~ .,
  data = df_train,
  method = "rpart",
  trControl = trControl,
  tuneGrid = hyperparameters
)

pred1 <- predict(class_model1, df_test)

cm1 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred1, reference = df_test$target, positive = "high")

cm1$overall[1]
```

```{r}
class_model2 <- train(
  target ~ .,
  data = df_train,
  method = "glm",
  trControl = trControl
)

pred2 <- predict(class_model2, df_test)

cm2 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred2, reference = df_test$target, positive = "high")

cm2$overall[1]

```

4.  Plot the comparison of the models in 3.

```{r}
plot(varImp(class_model1))
```

```{r}
plot(varImp(class_model2))
```

5.  What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data.

```{r}
final_model1 <- train(
  target ~ .,
  data = df_train,
  method = "rpart",
  trControl = trControl,
  tuneGrid = hyperparameters
)

final_pred1 <- predict(final_model1, df_test)

final_cm1 <- confusionMatrix(data = final_pred1, reference = df_test$target, positive = "high")

final_cm1$overall[1]
```

6.  Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5.

```{r}
df$target <- if_else(df$los < mean(df$los, na.rm=TRUE), 'short', 'long')

clean_df2 <- df %>%
  select(age, sex, raceethn, provider,
         moa, admtype, campus, b_wt, tot, target) %>%
  mutate(age = as.numeric(age),
         sex = as.factor(sex),
         campus = as.factor(campus),
         provider = as.factor(provider),
         moa = as.factor(moa),
         admtype = as.factor(admtype),
         b_wt = as.numeric(b_wt),
         tot = as.numeric(tot),
         target = as.factor(target)) %>%
  filter((raceethn != '') & (admtype != ''))

splitIndex <- createDataPartition(clean_df2$target, p = 0.4, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train2 <- clean_df2[ splitIndex,]
df_test2 <- clean_df2[-splitIndex,]

```

```{r}
tree_model2 <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train2,
                    control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 5))

fancyRpartPlot(tree_model2)
```

```{r}
trControl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)

hyperparameters <- expand.grid(
  cp = seq(0.001, 0.1, by = 0.001)
)

class_model3 <- train(
  target ~ .,
  data = df_train2,
  method = "rpart",
  trControl = trControl,
  tuneGrid = hyperparameters
)

pred3 <- predict(class_model3, df_test2)

cm3 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred3, reference = df_test2$target, positive = "long")

cm3$overall[1]
```

```{r}
plot(varImp(class_model3))
```

```{r}
class_model4 <- train(target ~ ., data = df_train2, method = "glm", trControl = trControl)

pred4 <- predict(class_model4, df_test2)

cm4 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred4, reference = df_test2$target, positive = "long")

cm4$overall[1]
```

```{r}
plot(varImp(class_model4))
```

```{r}
final_model2 <- train(
  target ~ .,
  data = df_train2,
  method = "rpart",
  trControl = trControl,
  tuneGrid = hyperparameters
)

final_pred2 <- predict(final_model2, df_test2)

final_cm2 <- confusionMatrix(data = final_pred2, reference = df_test2$target, positive = "long")

final_cm2$overall[1]
```

7.  Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results.

I think the results from our model building are promising. I was able to create two models, one predicting whether the total will be high, or low, and whether the stay of the patient will be long or short. Both final models have around an 80% accuracy, with room to improve. With that being said, I believe both models could be very much improved. I believe if I had used more features that are taken from patients initially, before their stay is over, the models could be very useful. Especially in the case of the model predicting the length of stay, this model can be useful however one feature makes it so this must be predicted after the fact. This feature is the total payment feature for this model. Since patients will not know the cost of their treatment until after the treatment, this model will not be able to accomplish as much as it could. Another way I would have like to go about this model is making it a regression model to predict the actual length of the stay, rather than a binary variable. However, the models still both predict their outcomes with high accuracy, and are very efficient all around.
